Pull requests welcome.

## Motivation

Windows' track information in the volume overlay thing is awful - it takes too long to disappear and consumes too much of the screen. It also does not display certain other pieces of information like album name, and whether or not shuffle is enabled.

I also wanted a notification of some sort when the play state or song has changed, which Windows could not do. Hence, this project was born.

## Current features

* It works (at least on my system (and at least as far as I have tested))
* Album art is automatically downloaded from The Internet
* It doesn't get in the way of your clicks
* Themeing
  * Either syncronised with GPMDP itself or your own custom theme. The choice is yours

## Planned features

* Different config options
  * Position
  * Animation direction
  * Popover duration / speed
  * File checking frequency
* An easy GUI based configuration
* A better default/missing album art icon
* A fancy program icon
